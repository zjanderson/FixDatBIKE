Bicycle mileage and maintenance log for Strave users

The purpose of this project is to track the hours and mileage on specific bicycles and components in order to keep on top of required maintenance tasks.

The project will utilize the Stravi for Developers API in order to retrieve data on specific rides and equipment.

Users will be able to set desired maintenance intervals for individual components, based on manufacturer recommendations.
